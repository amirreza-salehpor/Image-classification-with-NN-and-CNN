# Image classification with NN and CNN

# Example 13
The MNIST dataset has a collection of hand-written number images. The training data has 60000 images and the test data has 10000 images. Make a neural network which identifies the number in the image. Report the accuracies in train and test data, and also report 4 images from the test data that your model identifies wrong.

# Example 14
Repeat the previous exercise, but use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as your machine learning algorithm. Report the predictions of the 4 test images from the previous exercise and see if the CNN model identifies them correctly.

# Example 15
Download the chest x-ray image dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and build a CNN model which identifies pneumonia from an x-ray image. Use random sampling to separate 30 % of the entire data into a test dataset (donâ€™t use the predefined split). Report the accuracy in both train and test data. Try to achieve at least 95 % accuracy in the test data.
